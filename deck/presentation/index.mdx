<Notes>
  <p>
    Given these results, I've decided to give a broad overview of urql and
    graphql, with a demo to showcase urql at the end
  </p>
  <p>
    As it turns out, many people are unfamiliar with urql, so let's go ahead and
    answer that question first
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## what is urql?

<br />

export default CodeSlide

- **U**niversal **R**eact **Q**uery **L**ibrary
- Enables developers to use GraphQL on the frontend
- Lightweight open source GraphQL client
- Created and maintained by Formidable

<Notes>
  <p>urql is an acronym, but that still doesn't tell us much</p>
  <p>it's a tool, distrubited as a package on npm</p>
  <p>
    GraphQL is mentioned twice on this slide, and we are at a graphql meetup,
    but for those of us who may be unfamiliar, what exactly is graphql?
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## what is graphql?

<br />

export default CodeSlide

- protocol for declarative data fetching
- alternative to REST
- efficient, easy to use

<Notes>
  <p>
    graphql is a new way of efficiently and easily requesting data from a server
  </p>
  <p>i want to highlight the declarative data fetching piece</p>
</Notes>

---

## graphql query

export default CodeSlide

```gql
{
  user(id: "1") {
    id
    username
    email
    likedPosts {
      id
      title
      likes
    }
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  <p>this is a query for data from a hypothetical server</p>
  <p>we're telling the server what pieces of data we want</p>
</Notes>

---

## response

export default CodeSlide

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "1",
    "username": "rick",
    "likedPosts": [
      {
        "id": "4",
        "title": "Big candy mountain",
        "likes": 49
      },
      {
        "id": "7",
        "title": "Why candy corn is underrated",
        "likes": 88
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

<Notes>
  <p>
    the server responds with just what we asked for. nothing more, nothing less
  </p>
  <p>
    graphql is implemented over http and can be used with built-in networking
    functions like fetch, so what need does a graphql client serve?
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Why use a GraphQL client?

export default CodeSlide

- enables powerful developer tooling
- abstraction over networking
- usually performs caching
- integrates into our view layer

<Notes>
  <p>
    not to say a graphql client is required, it may just offer us some benefits
  </p>
  <p>
    on my previous project, we used urql and that was great, but on my current
    project we're not using a graphql client at all, and that's because we're
    optimizing for bundle size and we don't need some of the features like a
    cache, so we implement graphql requests with fetch by hand
  </p>
  <p>
    we've talked about graphql and graphql clients, but why should we consider
    urql specifically?
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Why urql?

<br />

export default CodeSlide

- Simple to set up and use
- Customizable
- Small bundle size (6.5kb min+gzip) & API
- Lower barrier to entry to GraphQL

<Notes>
  <p>
    really easy to get up and running with a fully functioning graphql client
  </p>
  <p>
    there are tons of use cases for graphql clients, and tons of specific
    features that we may want out of them. we've been urql to be flexible so
    that when we need more robust functionality, we can implement this
    functionality ourselves
  </p>
</Notes>

  <p>That was a lot, so here's a cute gif of a cat sitting in a bowl</p>

    When it comes to graphql clients, there is an elephant in the room, and it

## urql origin story

![origin-gif](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l2JdT4plpRnrpR1tK/giphy-downsized.gif?cid=6104955e71518c18cf53c98a9c3e16d146900b8b1956c3c2&rid=giphy-downsized.gif)

<Notes>
  <p>
    I'd like to take a little bit of time to discuss the motivations behind
    urql's creation
  </p>
</Notes>

sample package.json for an app using Apollo

export default CodeSlide

```json
                "dependencies": {
                    "apollo-cache-inmemory": "^1.1.7",
                    "apollo-client": "^2.2.3",
                    "apollo-link-context": "^1.0.7",
                    "apollo-link-http": "^1.3.3",
                    "react-apollo": "^2.0.4",
                }
```

---

sample package.json for an app using urql

export default CodeSlide

```json
                "dependencies": {
                    "urql": "^1.6.1"
                }
```

---

export default CodeSlide

sample client setup for an app using Apollo

```javascript
const httpLink = new HttpLink({
  uri: "/graphql"
})

const authLink = setContext(async (_, { headers }) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token")
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : ""
    }
  }
})

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
})
```

---

sample client set up for an app using urql

export default CodeSlide

```js
const client = createClient({
  url: "/graphql",
  fetchOptions: () => {
    const token = localStorage.getItem("token")
    return {
      headers: {
        authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : ""
      }
    }
  }
})
```

---

## Apollo Improvements

export default CodeSlide

- relatively new `apollo-boost` package wraps core Apollo client
- still need to download integration package (`@apollo/react-hooks`)

<Notes>
  <p>In summary, urql was created out of a need for a simpler graphql client</p>
</Notes>

## present day urql

export default CodeSlide

![now](https://media3.giphy.com/media/l2QZVEsc0VGXA6VCU/giphy.gif?cid=6104955e7505cf0820cad9ccb08d0286823a69f43098ab35&rid=giphy.gif)

## Compact Bundle Size

export default CodeSlide

<br />

<table style={{ margin: "0 auto", borderCollapse: "collapse" }}>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style={{ paddingRight: "48px" }}>urql</th>
      <th style={{ paddingRight: "48px" }}>urql & graphcache</th>
      <th>apollo boost & @apollo/react-hooks</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style={{ paddingRight: "48px" }}>6.5kb min+gzip</td>
      <td style={{ paddingRight: "48px" }}>14.5kb min+gzip</td>
      <td>30.1kb min+gzip</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<Notes>
  <p>
    We've kept up the bundle size nice and small and have created an Exchange
    called graphcache
  </p>
  <p>
    Without getting too deep into it, graphcache is a normalised cache
    implementation, which is essentially a more powerful caching mechanism that
    enables some nice features out of the box
  </p>
  <p>
    Apollo's default cache is a normalised cache, and that used to be a big leg
    up over urql. With graphcache and urqls new flexibility, we can now
    customize urql with a normalised cache if we need to
  </p>
</Notes>

## React Hooks

export default CodeSlide

```js
const [response] = useQuery({
  query: `
    {
      me {
        id
        username
      }
    }
  `
})
// {
//  fetching: false,
//  error: false,
//  data: { me: { id: "1", username: "fez"} }
// }
```

<Notes>
  <p>
    We've kept up to date with advances in React, now supporting usage with
    React Hooks, further simplifying urql
  </p>
</Notes>

## Programmable Core

export default CodeSlide

![exchange](exchange.svg)

<Notes>
  <p>
    This next feature is perhaps the most important one, it's what I like to
    call urql's programmable core
  </p>
  <p>What this diagram visualizes is urql's concept of an Exchange</p>
  <p>
    Exchanges are operation handlers. They allow us to process streams of
    graphql operations and operation results
  </p>
</Notes>

---

## Programmable Core

export default CodeSlide

![exchange-chain](exchange-chain.svg)

<Notes>
  <p>
    Exchanges are modular and can be linked together to form an operation
    pipeline
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of urqls core logic lives in a handful of default exchanges, and we can
    control what exchanges urql uses
  </p>
</Notes>

---

export default WhiteSlide

## Default Exchanges

![default-exchanges](default-exchanges.svg)

<Notes>
  <p>
    To summarize, urql was recently rewritten to allow flexibility in how it
    behaves, while maintaining its small bundle size and modern API
  </p>
  <p>Now, let's see it in action</p>
</Notes>
